# autoortho-scenery
Prepared X-Plane scenery packs for the autoortho project

# AutoOrtho Orthos Install

NOTE: This scenery pack contains no textures and requires [AutoOrotho](https://github.com/kubilus1/autoortho) to work.  Without this tool running this scenery pack will not function as intended.

## Usage

1. Extract this archive to a convenient location
2. Copy yOrtho4XP_Overlays to your X-Plane 'Custom Scenery' directory.
   Combine with existing yOrtho4XP_Overlays if necessary
3. Run autoortho and point your 'Orthophoto dir' to this directory
